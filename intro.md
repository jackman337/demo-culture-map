[Geert Hofstede](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geert_Hofstede) is one of the most famous cross-cultural researchers in history.
He was the first person to use significant research data to map cultures on scales.

Today this data can be used via the [hofstede insights](https://www.hofstede-insights.com/) page, which provides a [tool](https://www.hofstede-insights.com/country-comparison/) to compare countries.
Also, the [Hofstede's Globe](https://exhibition.geerthofstede.com/hofstedes-globe/) can visualise dimensions scores across the world.
Since the dimension data he collected is downloadable and available to researchers [without asking for permission](https://geerthofstede.com/research-and-vsm/dimension-data-matrix/), let's 
try to create a streamlit-based interactive application which can explore cultural distances between countries or 
assign a country to a person based on his/hers position across the 6 proposed dimensions.

* Power distance (PDI)
* Individualism (IDV)
* Masculinity (MAS)
* Uncertainty avoidance (UAI)
* Long term orientation (LTO)
* Indulgence (IND)

### Disclaimer ⚠️

It's important to keep in mind that there are many counties without validated scores and in that case only educated guesses are provided.
Also, Geert likes to say that: 
> Dimensions do not exist. They are a product of our imagination, used for understanding.

Finally, this application is written only for fun and learning how to use Streamlit and no strong conclusions about cultures should be made based on it.
